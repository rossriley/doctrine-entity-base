### Doctrine Entity Base Class

This base class is designed to provide a few out of the box hooks for Entity classes.

#### Extending

Create your entity class and simply extend this base class. For example:

```
<?php

namespace Myproject;

use Doctrin\Entity\Base;

class Myentity extends Base
{
    
}


```
